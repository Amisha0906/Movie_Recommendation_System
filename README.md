## ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates two major approaches to building a movie recommendation engine:

Content-Based Filtering - a recommendation technique that suggests items to users based on the features (or content) of those items.
Collaborative Filtering - a recommendation technique to predict user preferences for items based on the preferences of similar users.

## ðŸ“ˆ Approach

### ðŸ”¹ Content-Based Filtering

1. Preprocessing the Genres

2. Creating TF-IDF Matrix - Converting genres into numerical features using the TF-IDF Vectorizer, which transforms genre text data into numerical feature vectors

3. Training KNN model - Using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with cosine similarity to identify similar movies.

4. Recommended similar movies based on the selected title

### ðŸ”¹ Collaborative Filtering

1. Creating a User-Movie Matrix - Since we're comparing users, this matrix helps us represent user behavior in a structured format, making it easy to compare users based on the movies theyâ€™ve rated
2. Calculating Similarity Between Users - Cosine Similarity and Pearson Correlation
3. Making Predictions and Recommendations -
   
      Finding top-k similar users,

      Predicting movie ratings using weighted averages,
  
      Recommending the top N movies that the target user hasnâ€™t seen
